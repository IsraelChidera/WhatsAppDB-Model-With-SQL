# SQL WhatsApp Database

This presentation showcases the implementation of a database infrastructure tailored to support WhatsApp operations. The database comprises of four core components: users, groups, group members and messages, which are interrelated and interdependent. To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended to periodically review the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to maintain a clear understanding of the relationships between these components. Additionally, implementing appropriate indexes, data partitioning, and optimized query plans can improve the overall efficiency of the database.
